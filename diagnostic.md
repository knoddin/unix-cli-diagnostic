# Unix/CLI Diagnostic

## Challenge

Carry out all of the following tasks using _only the command line_! As is
usually the case, you're welcome to use any resource you can find (except
another student, of course) to reach your answer.

## Navigating the Filesystem

Complete each of following steps, **in order** :

1. Create a new directory called `cli-diagnostic` inside the root directory of
this repository (`unix-cli-diagnostic`).

2. Create a new file inside `cli-diagnostic` called `rhyme.txt`.

3. Open `rhyme.txt` using Atom (via the terminal) and add the following text:

 "The rain in Spain falls mainly in the plain."

 Once you've done this, save the file and quit.

4. Make a directory inside `cli-dliagnostic` called `temp`. Inside it, create a new blank file called `temp.md`.

5. Navigate back up to `cli-diagnostic`, and delete the `temp` directory (with `temp.md` inside of it). Use `ls` to show the contents of `cli-diagnostic` - was `temp` deleted?

6.) Navigate back up to `unix-cli-diagnostic` directory.

## Absolute and Relative Paths

Using Atom, open up `diagnostic.md` and write your answers below (where indicated).

1. Is `/Users/blah_blah/Desktop` a relative path or an absolute path? How do you know?

 This is a relative path because it has reference to the current directory on our computer.



2. Suppose that we're working on a project, and we want to use a font that's being hosted somewhere on the internet. Would we use an absolute or relative path to refer to it? Why?

 We would want to use an absolute path so that it goes directly to the location that the font is stored.



3. Now suppose that we have an image file living inside our project. Would we refer to it with an absolute or relative path? Why?

 We would want to use a relative path linked to the location of the file on our computer or current directory. This way, the image will always be available to us and is unlikely to change and break our site/project.
